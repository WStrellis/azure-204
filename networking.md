# Azure Virtual Networks
- *virtual network* - private IP address space. It can be divided into `subnets`
- *Delegated Subnet* - A subnet used for only one type of resource, such as database servers. Services within a subnet can communicate with services on other subnets of the same virtual network.
- *Network Security Group(NSG)* - filter traffic within a Vnet
- *Private DNS* - resolve hostnames within the vnet without going to external DNS servers.
