Four services for managing communication  between services:  
- Storage Queue
- Event Grid
- Event Hub
- Service Bus

Message-based Service
- Sender requires receiver to do something with the message
- The message includes data as well as information about the event that created the data
- Supports transactions for groups of messages

*Queue Storage*
- Simple, easy to setup
- supports queue size greater than 80gb

*Service Bus*
Intended for Enterprise applications with both cloud and on-premise services, higher security requirements.
- suports "Topics", allowing multiple Receivers to handle each message
- supports transactions, At-Most-Once delivery, batching messages, FIFO guarantee

*Message Delivery Strategies*
- At-Least-Once Delivery : Each message in the queue is guaranteed to be delivered to at least one Receiver. However, this makes it possible for a Receiver to get duplicate messages. App code needs to watch for duplicate messages.
- At-Most-Once Delivery : Messages may not be read by a Receiver, but duplicates are not possible.
- FIFO : Use a queue system with a FIFO guarantee.

Event-based Service
- Sender does not have any expectation that the Receiver will process or perform an action on the event
- Event only includes information about the event that occurred, no data that might have been generated by the event
